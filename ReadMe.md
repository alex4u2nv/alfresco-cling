Experimental Proof of Concept to use Alfresco as a DLNA server.
Alfresco is a phenomenal content management system, and can provide very fast browsing and searching capabilities to DLNA clients. 
This is because Alfresco's browsing and searching features relies on the Database or Solr4 indexes, as opposed to reading 
data on the file system, which can be very slow.

NB: this project is still in development/experimental phase as I learn how the Cling Framework works.
